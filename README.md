MarkovJunior is named after mathematician Andrey Andreyevich Markov, who defined and studied what is now called Markov algorithms. This project is a javascript port from the original implementation to be more friendily for uses in Web Application.

- Support browser for more use in web application and gameing.
- Provide another format of XML script for convinience use.
