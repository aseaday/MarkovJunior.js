[MarkovJunior](https://github.com/mxgmn/MarkovJunior) is a probabilistic programming language where programs are combinations of rewrite rules and inference is performed via constraint propagation. MarkovJunior is named after mathematician Andrey Andreyevich Markov, who defined and studied what is now called Markov algorithms. This project is a javascript port from the original implementation to be more friendily for uses in Web Application.
